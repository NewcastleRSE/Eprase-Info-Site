  <p>ePRaSE is a web-based tool intended to help NHS hospital sites assess and evaluate their ePrescribing systems to support optimisation and reduce harm caused by adverse medication prescribing events, ultimately improving patient safety.</p>
  <p>The tool provides a set of 15 fictional 'patients', which users set up in their live or test prescribing environments, and then provides a set of 45 prescribing test scenarios to challenge their system responses to risk. The performance of the prescribing system to the risk scenarios is provided in real time with a text-based report and accompanying visuals.
  The report is intended to guide and assist e-prescribing system users and new implementers in the optimisation of their systems.</p>
  
  <p>The latest version, ePRaSE 2024, is suitable for all sites actively using electronic prescribing systems for adult patients, and is accessible to registered users with nhs.uk or nhs.net email accounts (up to four users per Trust). The report applies to the Trust as a whole.</p>
  
  <p>The web based ePRaSE application is compatible with all modern browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Opera, Safari, and Edge.</p>

<p>ePrescribing (EP) is the utilisation of electronic systems to facilitate and 
  enhance the safety and efficacy of prescribing medicines to patients, and to 
  provide a robust audit trail for the entire medicines use process. Implementation 
  of EP with clinical decision support (CDS) has been extensively researched; 
  many studies have shown reductions in medication error rates and preventable 
  adverse effects. Following implementation of EP with CDS, medication errors 
  tend to decrease over time as system configuration is optimised for local use 
  and users adapt to the system. Greater patient safety benefits are documented 
  with experienced users rather than new implementers. However, upgrades and 
  system modifications can also introduce new safety risks, such as incompatibilities 
  with legacy software. Detecting and managing safety risks can be difficult 
  due to the complex nature of potential errors relating to not only the system 
  itself, but also the behaviours of users and characteristics specific to 
  organisations.</p>

<p>In the UK, there is currently no standard method of evaluating the effectiveness 
  of EP systems in preventing medication errors or potential adverse drug events. 
  NHS England, the UK Government organisation that oversees commissioning of NHS 
  services in England, has commissioned the development of an Electronic Prescribing Risk 
  and Safety Evaluation tool (ePRaSE) to evaluate the capabilities of the EP 
  systems currently implemented in UK hospitals. The ePRaSE assessment utilises 
  test patient data alongside previously validated prescribing scenarios and 
  offers a one-time, cross-sectional look at whether system decision support 
  provides appropriate advice to a prescriber.</p>
