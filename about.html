<p>ePRaSE is a web-based tool intended to help NHS hospital sites assess and evaluate their e-prescribing systems to support optimisation and reduce harm caused by adverse drug events, ultimately improving medication safety.</p>

<p>The tool provides a set of fictional patients, which users set up in their live or test prescribing environments, and then provides a set of randomised prescribing scenarios to challenge their system responses to risk. The performance of the prescribing system to the risk scenarios is evaluated in real time with a text-based report and accompanying visuals. Use of the tool is intended to guide and assist e-prescribing system users and new implementers in the optimisation of their systems.</p>

<p>E-prescribing (EP) is the utilisation of electronic systems to facilitate and enhance the safety and efficacy of prescribing medicines to patients, and to provide a robust audit trail for the entire medicines use process. Implementation of EP with clinical decision support (CDS) has been extensively researched; many studies have shown reductions in medication error rates and preventable adverse effects. Following implementation of EP with CDS, medication errors tend to decrease over time as system configuration is optimised for local use and users adapt to the system. Greater patient safety benefits are documented with experienced users rather than new implementers. However, upgrades and system modifications can also introduce new safety risks, such as incompatibilities with legacy software. Detecting and managing safety risks can be difficult due to the complex nature of potential errors relating to not only the system itself, but also the behaviours of users and characteristics specific to organisations.</p>

<p>In the UK, there is currently no standard method of evaluating the effectiveness of EP systems in preventing medication errors or potential adverse drug events. NHS England, the UK Government organisation that oversees commissioning of NHS services in England, has commissioned the development of an e-Prescribing Risk and Safety Evaluation tool (ePRaSE) to evaluate the capabilities of the EP systems currently implemented in UK hospitals. The ePRaSE assessment utilises test patient data alongside previously validated prescribing scenarios and offers a one-time, cross-sectional look at whether system decision support provides appropriate advice to a prescriber.</p>

<p>ePRaSE is a web-based assessment composed of five parts. The user:</p>
<ol class="w3-ol w3-margin-bottom">
	<li>provides information about EP usage within the organisation;</li>
	<li>enters demographic information for 15 test patients into either the live hospital patient administration system or a pre-production domain that mimics the live system;</li>
	<li>enters clinical data (e.g., diagnosed medical conditions, allergy status) for each of these test patients into the relevant part of the electronic patient record; 
	<li>completes 45 prescribing tasks, including a range of high-risk prescribing scenarios, where the clinical decision support response (or lack of) is recorded; and</li>
	<li>answers 3-5 questions on system configuration, e.g., whether the system allows insulin to be prescribed in millilitres.</li>
</ol>
<p>On completion, the user is presented with the results of the ePRaSE assessment.</p>
